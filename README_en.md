Full-stack data toolkit for China A-Share market — 12-layer architecture · 60 capability endpoints (55 primary + 5 backups) · 22 data sources · direct HTTP calls except two TCP client libraries (mootdx / baostock)

A self-contained Skill file that consolidates raw A-share data from 22 sources into a ready-to-use toolkit for AI coding assistants. No need to memorize mootdx candlestick parameters, Eastmoney PDF Referer headers, or iwencai X-Claw authentication — it's all handled. And when a primary source bans you, there's a backup-source quick reference to fall back on.

> Compatible with [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) · [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) · [OpenClaw](https://github.com/anthropics/openclaw)
>
> The Skill file is structured Markdown + embedded Python. Any AI coding assistant with context injection can use it.

## Quick Start

**3 steps, 2 minutes.**

```bash
# 1. Create skill directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/a-stock-data

# 2. Download SKILL.md
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/a-stock-data/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonlin1212/a-stock-data/main/SKILL.md

# 3. Install dependencies (V3.0: akshare no longer needed)
pip install mootdx requests pandas stockstats numpy baostock xlrd openpyxl
```

Launch Claude Code and say "Check the valuation of 688017" — the skill activates automatically.

> **Codex / OpenClaw users:** Paste the contents of SKILL.md into your system prompt or project context file. The embedded Python code is ready to execute.

## 60 Endpoints

There are 55 primary entries and 5 backups. Counts refer to capability entries: CSI/CNI or SSE/SZSE routes within one function count once; helpers and research candidates are excluded.

> **Counting convention:** the tables below have 61 rows but count as 60 capability endpoints — "Eastmoney Industry Reports" shares **the same endpoint** as "Eastmoney reportapi" (only the `qType` parameter differs) and "THS Northbound (historical)" is a local self-built cache (not a separate endpoint), so neither is counted; the single "EM Intraday Anomaly Pool" row covers **two** endpoints (`list` / `count`), adding one back. 61 − 1 − 1 + 1 = 60.

### Authentication

All integrated sources except iwencai require no user registration or API key. CSI, CNI and BSE need no user credentials; BSE establishes an anonymous site cookie. Only iwencai semantic search requires an API key ([apply here](https://www.iwencai.com/skillhub)). Optional research candidates are excluded from these capabilities.

## Data Source Priority (V3.2 re-ranked by IP-ban risk)

> **Principle: anything available from mootdx or Tencent (quotes / K-line / live price / market cap / financials) must use them first (never IP-banned). Eastmoney is only for its exclusive data, all routed through the throttled `em_get()`.**

| Priority | Source | Protocol | IP Ban Risk | Use |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-----|
| **1 (top)** | mootdx (TDX) | TCP 7709 | **Never banned** | K-line / order book / ticks / financials / F10 |
| **2 (top)** | Tencent Finance | HTTP | **Never banned** | Live price / PE / PB / market cap / turnover / index / ETF |
| 3 | THS Hot Stocks / Northbound | HTTP | Very low (zero auth) | Hot stocks / themes / northbound flow |
| 4 | Baidu Finance | HTTP | Very low | K-line (w/ MA5/10/20) |
| 5 | Sina Finance | HTTP | Low | Financial statements |
| 6 | cninfo | HTTP | Low | Filings |
| 7 | THS Consensus EPS | HTTP | Low (UA required) | Consensus EPS |
| 8 | iwencai | OpenAPI | Low (key required) | NL semantic search |
| 9 | **baostock** | TCP | Low (no registration) | Valuation history PE/PB/PS/PCF + turnover + suspension + ST + listing/delisting dates (**no Beijing Exchange**) |
| 10 | **SW Research** | HTTP | Low (public XLS) | Industry classification history |
| 11 | **PBoC** | HTTP | Low (official site) | Aggregate social financing |
| 12 | **NBS** | HTTP | Low (official site) | PMI |
| By data type | **CSI / CNI** | HTTP | Public files; avoid frequent downloads | Constituents/weights and CSI PE/dividend yields |
| Official backups | **SSE / SZSE / BSE** | HTTP | Anonymous access; throttle batch requests | SSE/SZSE margin and BSE current quotes/books, alongside existing exchange backups |
| **last (exclusive only)** | **Eastmoney** datacenter/push2/reportapi/search/np-weblist | HTTP | **Medium — has rate-limit risk** | Dragon-tiger / lockup / margin / block trade / shareholders / dividends / fund flow / reports / news (all via `em_get()`) |

> **Architecture:** Except mootdx and baostock (both TCP client libraries), all sources use direct HTTP API calls with no third-party data wrapper in between. **Eastmoney APIs are rate-limited; all calls go through `em_get()` for serial throttling. For batch jobs, increase `EM_MIN_INTERVAL`.**
>
> **Fallback:** When a primary source fails, check the "Backup Sources & Fallback Strategy" section in SKILL.md. Some core data types have independent backups on **different domains with separate rate limits**. Not every capability has a backup; always verify dates and completeness after fetching.

## FAQ

**Why are index weights not dated today? Can they be used for historical backtests?**
Constituents and weights may be published on different dates. The CNI endpoint returns a month-end snapshot; `date` is the source date. Current membership is not historical membership. This release does not integrate adjustment history or substitute zero for missing index PB.

**How do I run the two new backups?**
Execute the full Layer 12 code block in SKILL.md, then the official margin/BSE backup block. Query margin data separately for `SH` and `SZ`; BSE requires the expected session date. Date mismatches, incomplete pagination and unpublished data raise errors.

**Are easy_tdx and the new official THS API included?**
They are research candidates, not runtime dependencies. Auction integration needs Python 3.10+ compatibility work; the THS service requires a user key. See the [source integration record](docs/source-integration-v3.8.0.md) (Chinese). No installation dependencies were added.

## Verification

`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` extracts the shipped code directly from SKILL.md and checks dates, fields, symbol routing, units, pagination and error propagation. Live tests require explicit `ASTOCK_LIVE_TRADE_DATE` and `ASTOCK_LIVE_MARGIN_DATE` values matching current official data. See the [verification record](docs/source-integration-v3.8.0.md) (Chinese).
